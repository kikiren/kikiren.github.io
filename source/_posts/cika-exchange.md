title: Cika Exchange
---


In February of 2021, I created Cika Exchange based on my personal need: to climb in any gym in Shanghai. Since WeChat is the universal app in China, I decided to make a WeChat Mini program(MP) instead of a native app. With the help of Tecent Cloudbase (similar to Firebase), I was able to focus on buidling the app's core features without the hassle of managing servers.

After many previous experimental projects, Cika became my first app released to the public, and was an unexpected success! I got users' feedback immediately after its release and user numbers has been organically growing every day. Being able to make a tool that people will actually use and benefited from has always been my motivation of building apps. As of 2022, I'm still maintaining and developing Cika Exchange.

- A sub-application within the WeChat ecosystem that is widely used by rocker climbers in China to share their climbing gym punch cards, as well as finding outdoor climbing area information.
- Built in 2021, Cika Exchange has grown to 800 active monthly users, with a 30-day retention rate of 46%.
- This app was built with WeChat's native mini program framework MINA, a JavaScript front-end framework similar to VueJS, and is backed by Tencent Cloudbase. 
- It also uses Cloudbase CMS to manage app content and API, and uses Vant Web-app UI library.
