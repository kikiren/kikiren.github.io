- A **React** web-app that allows users to create more flexible reminders. Users can input reminders for tasks that have a more
flexible due date and the app will send an email reminder when the task is due, with the option to reset or extend the time.
- This app is backed by **Firebase**, uses Firestore as its database, uses Cloud Function to set up a cron job to send emails through
**Nodemailer**, and also uses the **MaterialUI** library.
