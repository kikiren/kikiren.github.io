**😊 Hi, I'm Kiki.**

I love **coding** and **climbing**. I started learning both since 2019 and although I'm not great at either yet, the journey has been incredibly fun and rewarding so far. I was a marketing manager before the dev life, after leading a couple of digital marketing projects, I got interested in how apps are developed. From there, I started to learn web development by myself.

In 2021, I released [my first application](https://kikiren.github.io/cika-exchange/) and people love it! I was really motivated from it, and since then I was onboarded to so many [amazing projects](https://kikiren.github.io/) and worked with excellent and experienced developers.

Presently, I am working as a Front-end Developer at [Wiredcraft](https://wiredcraft.com/) where I am contributing to ship new features and optimizing app performace for some of the world's best brands.

In 2022, I moved to 🇺🇸, I'm looking forward to continue my coding career here!

Cheers,

Kiki 🧗‍♀️
