**😊 Hi, I'm Kiki.**

I love **coding** and **climbing**. I started learning both since 2019 and although I'm not great at either yet, the journey has been incredibly fun and rewarding so far. I was a marketing manager before the dev life, after leading a couple of digital projects, I got interested in how apps are made. From there, I started to learn web development by myself.

In 2021, I released my first application - **[Cika Exchange](https://kikiren.github.io/cika-exchange/)** and people love it! I got really motivated from it.

Presently, I am working as a Front-end Developer at **[Wiredcraft](https://wiredcraft.com/)** where I am contributing to ship new features and optimizing app performace for some of the world's best brands.

In 2022, I moved to 🇺🇸, where I'm looking forward to continue my coding career.

My skills includes:

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks:** ReactJS, VueJS, NextJS, KeystoneJS, AdminJS, WeChat Mini Program, expressJS
- **UI libraries:** Ant Design, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Others:** Node, Redux, Sass, Firebase, Git, Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence

*Things I'm interested: GraphQL, Prisma, NestJS* 

Cheers,

Kiki 🧗‍♀️
